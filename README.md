## What is Photarium?

> **⚠️ SECURITY WARNING**: Photarium is currently designed for **local usage only** (running on your own machine or a secured internal network).
> The external upload API endpoint (`/api/upload/external`) currently has **NO authentication** and accepts uploads from any source.
> Do not deploy this to a public URL (like Vercel, Netlify, or a public VPS) without first adding authentication middleware or securing access at the network level.
> *Securing this API might be a high-priority item on our roadmap? If there were a roadmap, really? But at the moment I run this entirely locally, at or very close to localhost and the only person who might hack me has four paws, so I'm not super concerned..but you should be if you intend to run this anywhere you are not certain has some security in front of that endpoint.*

Photarium is a lightweight, self-hosted web application that turns Cloudflare Images into a complete asset management system. Perfect for:

- **Email campaigns** — Organize and share images across your marketing team
- **Website management** — Version control and quick distribution of web assets  
- **Content creators** — Rapid upload, tagging, and URL generation
- **Multi-app deployments** — Namespace isolation for different projects on one Cloudflare account

No vendor lock-in. Run it on your own infrastructure.

### Deep Control & Variants

![Image Detail View](docs/images/2026-01-08_18-26-58.png)

Every image includes a powerful detail view for granular control:

- **Metadata Management**: Edit title, folder, description, and tags while preserving original EXIF data.
- **Variant Assignment**: Designate specific images as variants (e.g., "Thumbnail," "Social Share") of a parent image. This keeps your library clean by grouping related assets under a single "master" image while serving optimized versions for specific contexts.
- **Accessibility**: Generate and edit ALT text to ensure your assets are accessible everywhere.

### Organized Gallery Management

![Photarium Gallery View](docs/images/2026-01-08_18-32-51.png)

The main gallery offers a clean, efficient way to browse and organize thousands of assets:

- **Smart Filtering**: Drill down by matching folders, tags, or specific time ranges.
- **Sticky Controls**: Filter/Sort bar stays pinned to the top, so you never lose context while scrolling deep lists.
- **Quick Actions**: Hover over any image for instant access to copy URL, edit metadata, or download.

## Requirements

Before you start, you'll need:

- **Node.js 18+** with npm
- **A Cloudflare account** (free tier available)
  - [Create a free account →](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up)
  - [Enable Cloudflare Images →](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/images/getting-started) (100k images/month, free)
- **Optional:** OpenAI API key for AI ALT text generation

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bleeckerj/nfl-photarium.git
cd nfl-photarium
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Cloudflare

Grab three values from your Cloudflare dashboard:

1. **Account ID** — [Dashboard → right sidebar](https://dash.cloudflare.com/)
2. **API Token** — [API Tokens → Create Token](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens)
   - Template: Custom token
   - Permission: `Cloudflare Images:Edit`
   - Resources: Your account
3. **Account Hash** — [Cloudflare Images dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/images/overview)

### 3. Environment Variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local`:

```env
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=abc123
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=your_token_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_HASH=your_hash_here
IMAGE_NAMESPACE=default
NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGE_NAMESPACE=default
```

**What these do:**
- `IMAGE_NAMESPACE` — Scopes uploads and duplicate detection (prevents collisions across projects)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGE_NAMESPACE` — Seeds the UI; override anytime in app settings

### 4. Run It

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

---

## Usage

### Uploading Images

1. Drag and drop into the upload area, or click to browse
2. (Optional) Select a folder and add comma-separated tags
3. Watch progress and copy the permanent Cloudflare URL

### Finding Images

Use the search bar for filename/folder/tag lookups, or filter by specific criteria:
- **Grid View** — Visual browsing
- **List View** — Bulk operations and detailed metadata
- **Pagination** — Date-labeled controls jump between pages of 12

### Organizing Your Library

**Email Campaigns:**
```
Folder: email-campaigns
Tags: newsletter, promo, header
```

**Website Assets:**
```
Folder: website-images
Tags: hero, about, testimonial
```

**Social Media:**
```
Folder: social-media
Tags: instagram, facebook, linkedin
```

---

## External API

Push images from scripts, Astro components, or any HTTP client:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/upload/external \
  -F "file=@photo.png" \
  -F "folder=campaign-2025" \
  -F "tags=newsletter,featured" \
  -F "namespace=production"
```

**Fields:**
| Name | Required | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| `file` | ✅ | Image file (max 10 MB) |
| `folder` | ❌ | Folder name |
| `tags` | ❌ | Comma-separated list |
| `namespace` | ❌ | Override default namespace |
| `originalUrl` | ❌ | For duplicate detection |

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "abc123",
  "url": "https://imagedelivery.net/HASH/abc123/public",
  "variants": ["public", "thumbnail", "medium", "large"],
  "uploaded": "2025-01-08T14:22:00Z"
}
```

For detailed examples (Node scripts, Astro integration, remote URLs), see [EXTERNAL_UPLOAD_API.md](./EXTERNAL_UPLOAD_API.md).

---

## File System Watcher (Optional)

Automatically upload images from a folder:

```bash
npm run watch:drop-off
```

Watches `./drop-off`, uploads to the `drop-off` folder with tag `found`. Configure with env vars:

```env
DROP_OFF_DIR=/path/to/watch
DROP_OFF_FOLDER=drop-off
DROP_OFF_TAGS=found
```

---

## Architecture

**Self-hosted** — Run on your own server, Vercel, Railway, or any Node.js host  
**Stateless** — All metadata stored in Cloudflare; no database required  
**Namespace-aware** — Isolate images across projects or teams on one account

---

## Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

1. Push to GitHub
2. [Connect to Vercel](https://vercel.com/import)
3. Add env vars in dashboard
4. Deploy

### Other Platforms

Works on any platform supporting Node.js 18+:
- **Railway** — [Docs](https://railway.app/)
- **Render** — [Docs](https://render.com/)
- **DigitalOcean** — App Platform
- **Netlify** — Functions + edge
